Getting the Nav bar I wanted wasnt too diffucult it was more figuring out how t oedit it so that it would link all of my pages together
After fiddiling with the nav bar for god knows how long only to find out it wasnt working because i forgot to link boot strap (nioce one me) I moved on to the img and text following it in the main bio.
The bio was easier to configure as i only floated the image and text next to it.
Moving on to the Portfolio page this was also one of the easier tasks as I only need to include the images and break them into a grid and then into there own rows,
Now for the most annyoing part for me, the contact page.
This was so frustating to figure out that I needed a card, button, and a forms. As opposed to the previous task this wasnt a complet copy and paste which gives me so much repecst for the people who made bootstrap, considering I onl;y copy pasted essetially while they just made this whole thing.
This was eye opeing and I;m so priveledge to be able to what feels like cheat with bootstrap.
